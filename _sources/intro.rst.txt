GridFix Introduction
====================

GridFix is a Python toolbox to facilitate preprocessing of scene fixation data for region-based analysis using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). 

Our `recently published manuscript <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00491>`_ [1] describes how this approach can be used to evaluate models of visual saliency above and beyond content-independent biases. Please also see [2] for a previous description of the approach and `our ECVP 2016 poster <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.571067>`_ for an overview about the structure and workflow of the GridFix toolbox.

Example data and Jupyter Notebooks for the "Tutorial" section are also available for download at https://github.com/ischtz/gridfix-tutorial/releases.

Features
--------
- Define image parcellations (region masks) based on a regular grid (RegionSet), with other parcellation types planned for future versions
- Apply these parcellations to collections of images or saliency maps (ImageSet)
- Define features to assign a value to each region X image (e.g., mean saliency of each region)
- Explicitly model central viewer bias using different approaches (e.g. euclidean distance, Gaussian)
- Output the resulting feature vectors for GLMM-based analysis (see [1-2])
- Create R source code for subsequent GLMM analysis using lme4
