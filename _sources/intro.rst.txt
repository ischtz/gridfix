GridFix Introduction
====================

GridFix is a Python toolbox to facilitate preprocessing of scene fixation data for the grid-based analysis approach first described in [1]. 

A manuscript describing the toolbox in detail is currently in preparation and we will make the toolbox and an example dataset available here upon its acceptance. In the meantime, the poster we presented at ECVP 2016 in Barcelona gives an overview about the structure and workflow of the GridFix toolbox: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.571067

Toolbox Features
----------------
- Define image parcellations (region masks) based on a regular grid (RegionSet), with other parcellation types planned for future versions
- Apply these parcellations to collections of images or saliency maps (ImageSet)
- Define features to assign a value to each region X image (e.g., mean saliency of each region)
- Explicitly model central viewer bias using different approaches (e.g. euclidean distance, Gaussian)
- Output the resulting feature vectors for GLMM-based analysis [1]
- Create R source code for GLMM analysis using lme4
