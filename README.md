GridFix is a Python toolbox to facilitate preprocessing of scene fixation data for the grid-based analysis approach first described in [1]. 

A manuscript describing the toolbox in detail is currently in preparation and we will make the toolbox and an example dataset available here upon its acceptance. In the meantime, please take a look at a [reprint of our ECVP 2016 poster](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.571067)[2].
