GridFix is a Python toolbox to facilitate preprocessing of scene fixation data for the grid-based analysis approach first described in [1]. 

A manuscript describing the toolbox in detail is currently in preparation and we will make the toolbox and an example dataset available here upon its acceptance. In the meantime, the `ecvp2016` subfolder contains a reprint of our ECVP 2016 poster for your convenience.
